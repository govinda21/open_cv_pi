open_cv_pi
==========

This program is for autonomous line follower bot using Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi camera. Here I am using opencv on Raspberry Pi to give the command to bot. I am using Brick Pi for controlling the motor. It can detect and track white and black line.
Always use the latest committed code for better result.
