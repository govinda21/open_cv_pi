open_cv_pi
==========

The project name Ball Tracking Pi is an opencv project. In this project we are using Raspberry Pi. 
The project is for making an autonomous line follower bot using the technique of image processing.
This can track white and black line. There is an argument which let you chose which colored line you want to follow.
Since it is just an introduction, i cannot give all the technical details in this parafraph. So stay along with me to have your own Line Follower Pi.
Though it is a basic project in opencv but for Raspberry Pi user it will be a good start to opencv.
No need to worry about it. Even you are a beginner to opencv. 
I will guide you from the installation of opencv on your Pi to the completion of this project.

Components required for this project are:
	1> Raspberry Pi
	2> Raspberry Pi camera
	3> Brick Pi ( for controlling motors )
	4> Two lego motors
	5> Wifi adapter 
	6> Wifi connection
	7> 8 GB SD card
	8> Power cable for your Raspberry Pi
	9> Preferably a new case for your Raspberry Pi and Brick Pi, which is recently designed by me. Just for the safety of your Raspberry Pi and Brick Pi. 
	
Now let us build your own Line Follower Pi in following simple steps :

	STEP 1: Installation of opencv on your Raspberry Pi - We will install opencv on the Raspberry Pi. I have documented the installation guide for opencv on Raspberry Pi
				Here is the link to the installatin guide for opencv on Raspberry Pi : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1op8RSzmRqjiwh9KCkuavni5GiDaExN0I9GA6pvZy1EI/edit
				With the help of that document you will be able to run some simple opencv program with and without using Raspberry Pi camera.
